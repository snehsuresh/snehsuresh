# 👋 Hey there

I'm Sneh, a Data Scientist and Software Engineer with 7 years of hands-on across **data science, machine learning, software engineering**, and **ML/Cybersecurity research**. My journey has been a blend of **backend engineering, predictive modeling, cloud computing**, and **LLM robustness research**, driven by my curiosity and love for **programming, math, and problem-solving**.

Currently, I’m pursuing my **Master’s in Data Science** at **UMass Dartmouth**, where I work as a **Graduate Research Assistant**, exploring the fascinating intersection of **large language models, adversarial robustness, and multimodal learning**.


## What I'm Currently Exploring  

- **Neural Volatility Forecasting** - combining time series modeling and deep learning to predict market volatility with higher accuracy.
- A **domain-agnostic chatbot** that dynamically adapts to selected domains via **generative distilled models**.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning in LLMs** - blending symbolic logic with deep learning to improve reasoning and commonsense understanding.  
- **Custom loss functions** for better multimodal alignment in **LLMs**.  


## 💡 What I Do  

🔧 **Machine Learning & Data Science:**  
- Demand Forecasting, Predictive Modeling, and Player Retention Analysis.  
- Building **domain-agnostic chatbots** with knowledge distillation and hardware-aware adaptation.  
- Enhancing **LLM robustness** using novel techniques to detect and mitigate **backdoor attacks** in SOTA LLM models.

💻 **Software Development:**  
- Full-stack application development using Python, FastAPI, and React  
- Scalable cloud deployments on **AWS** (EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS)  
- Backend development focusing on **performance optimization and modular design**

🔬 **Research:**  
- Multimodal LLMs - building frameworks that dynamically **align textual and visual embeddings** for coherent contextual understanding  
- Designing novel **loss functions** for balanced multimodal learning  
- Exploring **adversarial robustness** and **anomaly detection** in generative models

👨‍🏫 **Mentoring & Teaching:**  
- I love **mentoring budding engineers** - whether it's Python scripting, backend coding, or building software and machine learning concepts  
- Teaching not only helps others but **reinforces my own knowledge**. Contact me @snehpillai02@gmail.com  

## Beyond Tech  

When I’m not being an absolute nerd, you’ll find me:  
- 🏏 Following sports - Wrestling, NBA, cricket, and NASCAR.
- 🏋️‍♂ Hitting the gym - **Current bests**: Bench 250, Squat 330, Deadlift 400. 
- 🎮 Gaming - FPS and strategy games like **Titanfall**, **Halo**, and yes - I still enjoy **Black Ops 2** like it’s 2012.

Want to collaborate on a cool project? Curious about my research? Or just want to geek out over tech, games, or fitness?
